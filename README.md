# Isochrone-TL
An isochrone map of the public transportations of Lausanne, Switzerland

A nice application that will show you in color the time needed to get from a point A to a point B in Lausanne in a matter of seconds with a nice map on the background.
Credits go to the TL (c) for their data and OpenStreetMap (c) for their maps.

Also the data is outdated. No public version available, sorry. Should work with mostly any city in the world if the local transportation system has the same way of storing data.
